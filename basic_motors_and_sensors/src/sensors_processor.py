# They are created outside the "listener" function so that they are "in scope" (i.e. readable) when they are eventually used within the Callback function(s) invoked by the Subscriber(s) upon receipt of incoming messages (here the callback is "cal_and_pub_A0")

    # calibrate the relationship between the signal that comes in and the signal in real units

    # Example: MaxBotix LV-EZ02 says: 
    # Distance in Inches = Volts / (Vcc/512). 
    # For A0, Vcc is 3.3 Volts and signals are in 2^10 levels from 0 to Vcc
    # Therefore (Distance in Meters) = 0.0254 (m/in)*(distance in Inches)
    
##### UPDATE THESE EQUATIONS
    analog_volts = analog_level * (1.0/1.0)
    distance_meters = analog_volts / (1.0/1.0) * 1.0
